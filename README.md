Detecting Building Defects Using Convolutional Neural  Networks

Overview-
The Detection of defects including cracks and spalls on wall surface in high-rise buildings is a crucial task of buildingsâ€™ maintenance. Clients are increasingly looking for fast and effective means to quickly and frequently survey and communicate the condition of their buildings.

Hardware And Software designing-
1. Strategy: matching the problem with the solution.
2. Dataset preparation and preprocessing. Data collection. Data visualization. Labeling. Data selection. Data preprocessing. Data    transformation.
3. Dataset splitting into train data and test data.
4. Modeling. Model training. Model evaluation and testing. Improving predictions with ensemble methods.
5. Model deployment.
